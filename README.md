# DSP-VHDL-Arty-S7
This is a project to establish a curriculum to learn Digital Signal Processing and VHDL concurrently using an Arty S7 development board. This repository represents my efforts to learn and apply these principles. The outline of this curriculum was created using Chat-GPT and all information is either cited or otherwise stated by me as I have learned the principles.

The end goal of the curriculum is to culminate in a project that demonstrates a thorough understanding of DSP principles and proficiency in VHDL.

## Curriculum
### Phase 1: Digital Logic Foundations
Goal: Build comfort with VHDL, clocking, counters, and fixed-point arithmetic
#### LED Blinking and Counters

#### PWM Basics

#### Fixed-Point Arithmetic

#### Sine Wave Lookup

### Phase 2: Intro to DSP Signals
Goal: Learn how DSP transforms signals inside the FPGA
#### Moving Average Filter

#### FIR Filter (Hand-coded)

#### IIR Filter (Hand-coded)

#### Frequency Response Estimation

### Phase 3: Real-World DSP (with ADC/DAC PMODs)
Goal: Process real analog signals, such as audio
#### Signal Loopback (ADC -> DAC)

#### Low-Pass Filter for Audio

#### High-Pass / Band-Pass Filters

#### Real-Time Moving Average

### Phase 4: Advanced DSP Techniques
Goal: Move toward professional-level DSP projects
#### FFT Implementation

#### Convolution Reverb

#### Digital Modulation (ASK/FSK/BPSK)

#### Adaptive Filters (LMS)

#### Real-time Spectogram

### Phase 5: System-level Projects (Capstones)
Goal: Put everything together
#### Audio Equalizer

#### Software-Defined Radio (SDR) - Basic

#### Custom DSP Accelerator
