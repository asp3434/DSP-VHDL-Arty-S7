2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led0 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led0) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led1 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led1) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led2 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led2) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#4 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led3 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led3) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#5 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led4_b direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led4_b) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#6 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led4_g direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led4_g) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#7 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led4_r direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led4_r) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led0 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led1 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led2 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led3 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led4_b relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led4_g relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led4_r relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
